__main__.py //where code is executed from

or 

main.py //with the clause if __name__=="__main__":

gameClasses
    __init__.py //This defines that a folder is a module
    Deck.py     //We can put each class in a separate file
    Player.py
    GameStatus.py

gameMethods
    __init__.py
    gameMethods.py

Notes
each module should have a __init__.py file that is what
determines the folder to be a module. Otherwise python 
wouldn't know that it is a module.

.pyc files are compiled code for run time use. 

There are two common ways to execute python code from "main" files.
1. Run from __main__.py
2. Run from main.py with if __name__=="__main__": clause
